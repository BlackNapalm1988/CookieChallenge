## Original Game
By Sophia Duncan  
For Python Game Design    

This is designed off of Chip's Challenge, and reformatted as a child who is sneaking around at night.  
The child's goal is to collect all the cookies, and get to the door.  
This has to be done while avoiding an enemy, trap floors, and beating the clock.
